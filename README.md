# Alumni Directory Smart Contract

## Project Description

The Alumni Directory is a decentralized smart contract built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity programming language. This project creates a transparent and immutable alumni network where graduates can register their profiles, connect with fellow alumni, and maintain professional relationships in a trustless environment.

The contract enables alumni to:

- Register their professional profiles with graduation details, current employment, and contact information
- Connect with other registered alumni through a bidirectional connection system
- Maintain a permanent, verifiable record of their academic credentials and professional network

This decentralized approach ensures data integrity, prevents unauthorized modifications, and creates a reliable alumni verification system that institutions and employers can trust.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize alumni networks by leveraging blockchain technology to create:

**üéì Verified Alumni Networks**: Build trust through immutable graduation records and verified professional profiles stored on the blockchain.

**üåê Global Connectivity**: Enable alumni from different institutions to connect and collaborate across geographical boundaries without intermediaries.

**üîí Data Sovereignty**: Give alumni complete control over their professional data while maintaining privacy and security through decentralized storage.

**üìä Transparent Networking**: Create transparent connection histories that help build meaningful professional relationships based on verified academic backgrounds.

**üè¢ Institutional Trust**: Provide institutions with a reliable system to maintain long-term relationships with their graduates and verify alumni status for various programs.
